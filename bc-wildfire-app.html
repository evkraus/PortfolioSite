            <h2 class="h2 text-center">Goal</h2>
            <p class="proj-text">The primary objective of this project was to address a specific opportunity for enhancement within an existing mobile application, aligning closely with the client's aspirations for improved user experience. Leveraging my expertise in UI/UX design, the focus was to revamp the app's interface to better serve the client's objectives and user needs. While the project shared similarities with previous UI/UX endeavors, the emphasis here was on innovating within an established framework. Additionally, the introduction of mandatory user testing added a new dimension, necessitating creative solutions to ensure optimal user engagement and satisfaction in line with the client's overarching goals.</p>

            <h2 class="h2 text-center">Narrative</h2>
            <p class="proj-text">The app I went ahead to redesign is the BC Wildfireâ€™s app, as I was searching for an app, I thought my best approach would be to look at apps I have downloaded myself. After searching multiple apps BC Wildfire app had way too many clear problems, poor use of buttons, bad navigation, etc, I felt I needed to do it as my project.</p>

            <h2 class="h2 text-center">Research</h2>
            <p class="proj-text">I began this project with my research process, this consisted of identifying issues, target audience, persona, user scenarios, and a competitive analysis.</p>
            <p class="proj-text"><strong>Issues:</strong> I began by identifying the main issues of the app that were easy to tell at first glance, such as the lack of an onboarding/home screen, the clutter and grouping of fire icons on the map as you zoom out, and no description of colour meaning.</p>
            <p class="proj-text"><strong>Target Audience:</strong> The target audience of this app would include individuals residing within BC, Canada primarily including residents, tourists, hikers, outdoor enthusiasts, and individuals involved in emergency management or firefighting operations.</p>
            <p class="proj-text"><strong>Persona:</strong> After identifying the target audience I used it to create a persona, this persona was a nature lover who loves to go on hikes. I focused the user personas goals and frustrations around the fact that they enjoy nature and hikes while also tying them into the app, this made it easier to find any additional issues, such as adding more options for current locations as well as reporting fires.</p>

            <img src="img/uiuxprojects/firePersona.png" class="img-fluid fire-persona" alt="BC Wilfire Persona">
            </div>

            <div class="spacer-small"></div>

            <p class="proj-text"><strong>User Scenario:</strong> Using the user persona I was able to create multiple user scenarios, this helped me narrow down the problems with much more detail as well as identify some I had not even thought of before. </p>
            <p class="proj-text"><strong>Competitive Analysis:</strong> As the final step of my research process for this project I did a competitive analysis, I completed this analysis on a competitive app called Firesource. I used this analysis to identify UI aspects this app was successful with compared to BC Wildfire; this process will potentially influence my prototyping. </p>

            <h2 class="h2 text-center">Design</h2>
            <p class="proj-text"><strong>Low Fidelity Mockups:</strong> During this time, I took all my ideas of the issues, thought of possible solutions and drew them out creating low fidelity mockups or wireframes.  </p>

            <div class="spacer-small"></div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 text-center">
            <img src="img/uiuxprojects/fireLow.png" class="img-fluid fire-draw" alt="BC Wilfire Low Fidelity Mockup">
            </div>

            <div class="spacer-small"></div>

            <p class="proj-text"><strong>Typeface | Colours:</strong> Once I had my low fidelity mockups created, I went ahead and created a small style guide looking at what typefaces and colours I would use for the app before beginning in Figma. </p>

            <h2 class="h2 text-center">High Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
            <p class="proj-text"><strong>High Fidelity Mockups:</strong> During this process I went into Figma and started by creating the pages I drew on paper, adding no functionality until I was satisfied with the overall design. Once I was satisfied, I added the functionality, this took the most time and was the task that I ran into the most issues. The issues arose mainly due to the use of the new functonality I was testing with Figma as I needed a scrollable map with static icons. However, it took quite a long time and the feeling of having it completed was well worth it.</p>
            <p class="proj-text"><strong>User Tests:</strong> Once completed with the high fidelity mockups I performed 4 user tests to air out any possible problem or bugs. These tests were complete by first giving a user a task to complete within the app then timing them, while conducting the test I would observe from the side and take notes of any frustrations, confusion or problems that have occurred.</p>
